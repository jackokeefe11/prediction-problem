    "## Explanation for dropping predictors \n",
    "\n",
    "I completed this method by combining different methods of dropping predictors. I used some processes we didn't learn in class. I dropped 716 different predictors this way, which I assume is too many so I will go back and reprocess it. This, however, was incredibly helpful in creating my models as they only took a few minutes relative to a few hours that some other people were working with. Once I have a model I am comfortable with, I will add back in some predictors and see if it makes a difference. With this code alone and my models, I achieved a test RMSE of 9.29, which is currently placed at #16. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code works by: \n",
    "1. Calculating the mutual information between each predictor in the dataset x and the target variable y. Mutual information measures the dependency between the variables, with higher values indicating stronger dependency. Missing values in x are filled with the column mean, which could have been something else. For example, the median. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a DataFrame mutual_info_df containing the feature names and their corresponding mutual information values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select the top 200 features with the highest mutual information values. These features are stored in the top_mutual_info_features list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Filter the dataset x to keep only the selected features from the previous step, resulting in the x_filtered DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Apply Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) using a Decision Tree Regressor as the estimator. RFE is a wrapper method that recursively removes features based on their importance. The goal is to select the top 50 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Fit the RFE model on the filtered dataset x_filtered, handling missing values by filling them with the column mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Get the selected features from RFE using the support_ attribute, which returns a boolean mask indicating the selected features. The final_selected_features array contains the names of these selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Filter the dataset x_filtered to keep only the final selected features, resulting in the x_final DataFrame."
